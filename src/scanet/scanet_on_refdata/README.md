# SCANet on the reference datasets

In this Python script, gene co-expression networks (GCNs) and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are inferred, in addition, potential drug candidates are identified using the provided reference datasets. Initially, it reads the data, converts it to the h5ad format, and visualizes it. Subsequently, representative samples are obtained by averaging neighboring samples. Based on the correlation between genes, modules of genes are generated. The most two modules, exhibiting the highest correlation with the two conditions, are selected. The GRNs for these selected modules are inferred. Finally, potential drug candidates are identified.


## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- scanet
- anndata
- scanpy
- pandas
- os

## Method parameters

- `N` : Number of representative cells/samples per cluster.
- `correlation_cutoff` : Specifies the minimum threshold for co-expression strength that defines whether an edge should be included in the network. Edges with co-expression values below this threshold will be excluded from the network.

## Usage

The script can be executed from the command line with appropriate arguments:

```bash
python scanet_on_ref_data.py --c <input_file_exhausted> --d <input_file_macrophages> --o <output_directory> --n <num_rep_cells> --t <correlation_cutoff>
```


## Inputs

- `input_file_exhausted`: Path to the first input file which is the exhausted.tsv file.
- `input_file_macrophages`: Path to the second input file which is the Macrophages.tsv file.
- `output_directory`: Directory where the output will be stored.
- `num_rep_cells` : Number of representative cells. It has the default value 75.
- `correlation_cutoff` : Minimum threshold for co-expression strength. It has the default value 0.85.

## Outputs

In the provided directory, you will find the following :

- `network.tsv` : A tsv file which represents the two GRNs of the two module, which have the highest correlation to macrophages pretreatment and exhausted conditions.
- `outs_scan` : A folder which has the plots of gcn and grn with/without drug candidates for the two conditions. This is not required, but I added them. 
- `net.pkl` : A pickle file that include the inferred modules. It will be used later in the downstream analysis.
## Example

To run the script with example data:

```bash
python scanet_on_ref_data.py --c "data\out_CD8_exhausted.tsv" --d "data\out_Macrophages.tsv" --o "output/" --n 75 --t 0.8
```

Replace `data\out_CD8_exhausted.tsv`, `data\out_Macrophages.tsv`, and `output/` with your actual input file paths and desired output location.

The last two arguments `--n` and `--t` are not required as they have the defult values 75 and 0.8 respectively.
