Tool name: MATLAB Tool for Modulated Gene/Gene Set Interaction (MAGIC) Analysis
function url:  https://github.com/chenlabgccri/MAGIC/tree/master

Input: 
	- DATA: gene expression data, KxN numeric matrix where K is number of genes (or gene sets) and N is number of samples
	- GROUP: binary vector where 0 implies one condition and 1 implies another, N-length vector for N samples
	- BONF: flag, set to 1 for Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, set to 0 for raw p-value analysis
	- EQU_SAM_SIZE: sample size for comparing correlation coefficients, recommended to be set as average of number of samples for each condition
	- P_CUTOFF: p-value threshold, recommended 0.05
	- MOD_SCORE_CUTOFF: biological significance threshold, recommended 0.6
	- OUTPUT_FILENAME: desired string for TXT file that will be generated

Output: 
	- P1: p-value elements from modulation test, KxK symmetric matrix where K is number of genes. P1 values below p_cutoff imply strong correlation in Condition 2 samples
	- P0: KxK symmetric matrix where K is number of genes. P0 values below p_cutoff imply strong correlation in Condition 2 samples
	- MOD_SCORE: KxK symmetric matrix containing modulation scores for each pair. Larger scores imply stronger correlation in Condition 2 samples
	- ADJ_MAT: KxK symmetric matrix which is the adjacency matrix of the generated network. Non-zero denote the type of interaction between a pair.
