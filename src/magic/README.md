# MAGIC: Modulated Gene/Gene Set Interaction Analysis

MAGIC is a MATLAB tool used for the identification of differentially regulated gene pairs which are modulated by the state of a modulator protein, which influences the activity of transcription factors. Each pair that is identified is correlated (positively or negatively) in one of the modulation states. 
Within the context of this repository, it has been modified to generate the Differential Gene Regulatory Network of two gene expression datasets under different conditions.
The tool can also be used on to discover differential gene set interactions.

For each identified gene pairs, it is indicated that in one of the conditions, the interaction between them is either significantly upregulated or downregulated. 

### Brief Description of Algorithm & Recommended Use
For the generation of the DGRN, MAGIC performs Fisher-transformed pairwise correlation between genes inter-conditionally. A modulation analysis step is performed to identify the biologically and statistically meaningful gene pairs. This step involves a modulation test on the Fisher transformed  correlation coefficients (for distribution normalization) to test for statistically meaningful differential correlation and a modulation score calculation based on the inverse Fisher transformation using the equivalent sample size.Gene pairs that meet the criteria of the modulation analysis are assigned an edge weight that informs on the type of correlation(positive/negative) and the condition under which this interaction is observed. 

A more detailed overview of the algorithm can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/bionetslab/grn-benchmark/wiki#matlab-tool-for-modulated-genegene-set-interaction-magic-analysis)

Due to the fact that the tool generates a network where edge weights only inform on the type of interaction (positive or negative correlation under each condition), it is best used for an extension of its intended purpose; to investigate the effects of a condition on gene expression among similar samples.

## General Implementation: magic_tool.m

Generation of a Differential Gene Regulatory Network from two datasets. 

MAGIC can be run with default parameters as well as user-defined parameters:

**Usage**
```
matlab -r "magic_tool('input1_filepath', 'input2_filepath', 'output_path', 'bonf', 1, 'equ_sam_size', 100, 'p_cutoff', 0.05, 'mod_score_cutoff', 0.6);"
```
**Arguments**
  1.  `input1_filepath`: path to a TSV file containing normalized gene expression under condition 1
      - column 1 -> Gene: containing gene names
      - other columns -> Names of samples: containing gene expression for each gene within the sample
  2.  `input2_filepath`: path to a TSV file containing normalized gene expression under condition 2
      - column 1 -> Gene: containing gene names
      - other columns -> Names of samples: containing gene expression for each gene within the sample
  3. `output_path`: directory where you want the results to be stored
  4. Additional parameters (optional)
      - `bonf`:  flag for Bonferroni correction 
        - if set to 0, raw p-values will be analyzed
        - if set to 1, Bonferroni correction will be performed
        - DEFAULT: 1
      - `equ_sam_size`: numeric, equivalent sample size
        - sample size at which the correlation coefficients for sample sizes are compared
        - DEFAULT: the average of samples from each input/condition
      - `p_cutoff`: threshold p-value to determine the statistical significance of interactions
        - DEFAULT: 0.05
      - `mod_score_cutoff`: threshold to determine the biological significance of interactions
        - DEFAULT: 0.6
       
Alternatively, to use the tool with default parameters:
```
matlab -r "magic_tool input1_filepath input2_filepath output_path"
```

  **Note**
  - `output_path` directory must exist prior to the execution of the script
  - Ensure that the Gene columns of both inputs are identical. Number of samples per condition is arbitrary. 

### Output

1. network.tsv: TSV file containing all the edges of the DGRN with the following columns
    - Target: target gene of the edge
    - Regulator: source gene of the edge
    - Condition: condition that the edge belongs to

    - P-value: p-value of interaction [0,1]
    - Modulation Score: modulation score of interaction. Larger positive values indicate a stronger correlation in condition 2 samples
  
**Working Example**
```
 matlab -r "magic_tool('Datasets\out_CD8_exhausted.tsv', 'Datasets\out_Macrophages.tsv', 'Results');"
```
or

## Downstream Analysis: downstream_analysis_clust
This script performs downstream analysis by identifying modules in the network using three separate methods:
- Connected Components
- Modularity Maximization Community Detection
- Spectral Clustering
The GRN of each dataset are also inferred from the DGRN.
Lastly, it builds boxplots comparing the expression data of the genes in the important modules across conditions.

The analysis is detailed through in-code documentation. 

**Usage**
```
matlab -r "downstream_analysis_clust output_path"
```
**Argument**
- `output_path`: directory where you want the results to be stored
  - must exist prior to execution
   
**Note**
For reproductions, make sure to have the Datasets folder in the working directory for all the necessary data.
### Output
Below are some of the important visualizations resulting from the script. 

**Figure 1-Heatmap of Modulation Scores**
![heatmap](downstream/heatmap.png)
This is a heatmap generated form the modulation score matrix which MAGIC produces. It visualizes the modulation scores of each gene pair from the input datasets. Pinker areas indicate a higher correlation in the Macrophages samples. 

**Figure 2A-One of the Macrophage Specific Modules**
![fork](downstream/fork_module.png)
This is a Macrophage-specific module that appeared consistently, regardless of the approach used to identify modules. It was chosen due to its biological relevance in explaining CD8+ T-cell exhaustion.
**Figure 2B-Boxplot of the Module**
![forkbox](downstream/forkbox.png)
This is the boxplot of the gene expression from the previous module, wherein expression of each gene is compared in CD8+ T-cell samples and Macrophage samples. 
LEGEND: 
- blue: exhausted CD8+ T-cells
- pink: macrophages

**Figure 3-Boxplot of exhausted CD8+ T-cell specific module**
![hla-c-boxplot](downstream/box-HLA-C-cd8-cluster.png)
This is of the modules identified from the infered GRN of exhausted CD8+ T-cells. Notably, the genes in the module exhibit significant overexpression in T-cell samples.  
LEGEND: 
- blue: exhausted CD8+ T-cells
- pink: macrophages

All the visualizations produced by the downstream analysis can be viewed [here](downstream)

## Downstream Analysis: downstream_analysis_rand
This script performs an analysis of the MAGIC algorithm by comparing the effects of randomized grouping of the samples. The group vector is permuted randomly. The networks constructed from the original vector and the randomized vector are then studied by extracting modules from each and taking Jaccard Similarity. 

The analysis is detailed through in-code documentation. 

**Usage**
```
matlab -r "downstream_analysis_rand output_path"
```
**Argument**
- `output_path`: directory where you want the results to be stored
  - must exist prior to execution
   
**Note**
For reproductions, make sure to have the Datasets folder in the working directory for all the necessary data.
### Output

## Recommended Parameters
Downstream analysis with randomization of grouping highlights the importance of maintaining the integrity of the original grouping, as well as equivalent sample size as recommended by the authors (average of number of samples from each condition).
The Bonferroni flag can be changed according to the purpose that the tool is being used for.
The default value of `p_cutoff` reflects the null hypothesis.
However, the `mod_score_cutoff` relies on a subjective threshold for what is considered biologically significant, and can be adjusted according to the dataset that is being used. A more relaxed threshold can be used to aid in identifying more gene pairs.
